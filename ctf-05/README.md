# Awesomwasm 2023 CTF

## Challenge 05: *Draupnir*

Simplified vault where users can deposit and withdraw their tokens which will be internally accounted. The vault's `owner` can perform arbitrary actions through the `OwnerAction` entry point. In addition, a two step address transfer is implemented for the `owner` role.

### Execute entry points:
```rust
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    Deposit {},
    Withdraw { amount: Uint128 },
    OwnerAction { msg: CosmosMsg },
    ProposeNewOwner { new_owner: String },
    AcceptOwnership {},
    DropOwnershipProposal {},
}
```

Please check the challenge's [integration_tests](./src/integration_test.rs) for expected usage examples. You can use these tests as a base to create your exploit Proof of Concept.

**:house: Base scenario:**
- The contract has been instantiated with zero funds.
- `USER1` and `USER2` deposit `10_000` tokens each.
- The owner role is assigned to the `ADMIN` address.

**:star: Goal for the challenge:**
- Demonstrate how an unprivileged user can drain all the funds inside the contract.

## Vulnerability

When validating `proposed_owner` in function `accept_owner`, error is just declared and NOT returned, resulting in a statement without effect that allows any attacker to bypass the condition and claim the contractâ€™s ownership.

```rust
    if state.proposed_owner != Some(info.sender.clone()) {
        ContractError::Unauthorized { };
    }
```
## Solution

Solution is to simply return the error that has been declared in `accept_owner` function.

```rust
    if state.proposed_owner != Some(info.sender.clone()) {
        return Err(ContractError::Unauthorized { });
    }
```
